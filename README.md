# Learning Javascript fundamentals.

This is the final excercise of the javascript fundamentals courses.

## Application Description

The application displays information about star wars heroes and planets. 
It is based on vanilla javascript including some vital packages to make it work properly. It also simulates a SPA (single page application) using no frameworks or libraries, just vanilla javascript.

<br/> This will help us better understand the need for javascript fundamentals in our daily tasks using libraries like ReactJs. 

## Steps

There are 11 main steps to complete the application. Each step has a clear description.

- app.js - init App 
- app.js - Create tabs and welcome screen
- eventListeners.js - verify that tabs are working
- people.js / planets.js - render Planets/People dummy content
- people.js / planets.js  - build a function to retrieve each planet/person
- api.js - fetch and use onSuccess to retrieve ðŸ¤– star wars ðŸ¤– data based on the provided url
- api.js - play with the data coming from the api
- eventListeners.js - use addEntities directly without eventlistener first and use it in the listener
- people.js / planets.js  - get a list of planet/person elements
  > a) use appendListOfElements <br />
  > b) pass specific props to Planet and Person
- Build people.js - add data attribute to open-planet button
- Build eventListeners.js - render planet info element 
  > a) print results to the console <br />
  > b) extract planet info outside of a promise
